# NewtonRaphson
This repo includes the method to solve functions/equations and determine the root using the Numerical Newton-Raphson method algorithm.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### Included files
There are in total 2 files in the repository one titled **MATLAB** and one titled **Python**. So you can use either syntax and program/language to numerically determine the roots of an equation/function using the Newton-Raphson Method or algorithm.

##### MATLAB methods
The MATLAB file contains two methods. Both follow the same algorithm of Newton-Raphson, however the **Method 2** has been written for those who don't have access to the Math Tool box on MATLAB or have an older/obsolete MATLAB version that is not connected to the internet, or for those who are using a questionable version of MATLAB ;) The **Method 2** uses a user defined function as a separate matlab file and the user herself/himself has to define the derivative of the function as well as a separate matlab file.

##### Each directory also contains a separate README.md file that contains more information for that particular syntax/method.

## Happy Coding
